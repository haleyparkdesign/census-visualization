# PROJECT 3 - Census Visualization

**Using data from the US Census, design a 2D visualization that explains the information. Pay special attention to the way you construct the story around it.**

## Goals

- Learn to identify potential narratives in data sets
- Learn to develop a visual framework that function as stories
- Learn to use color, composition and typographic hierarchy
- Become more familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS


## Process

- Students work in groups of three or four.
- Complete readings to become familiar with multiple critical issues surrounding census and the US’s shifting population.
- Locate viable narratives within the data, assess the potential of the data, and develop articulate appropriate 2D visualizations.
- Test the design with users that are not familiar with the project. Do they understand the information? Do they interact with the website how it was designed?
- Do not implement interactive add-ons until April 6th. Those will be included after the presentation of the static visualisation (after Spring Break).
 

## Requirements

- To be viewed on a computer, optimized for the web.
- Use D3.js or P5.js to build the visualizations. 
- There should be at least 3 different graphic forms. Use the examples shown in class to build them.
- The design should be completely subordinated to the information and its explanation.

## Requirements Static visualization

You’ll need to implement interactivity in the future. Think about how you will add that option, without implementing it in this project.


## Requirements Interactive visualization

Use interactive implementations such as filterings, transitions or animations.


## Important dates

March 23:  Analyze the data, sketch multiple ideas. Think about what each one is going to do and how. Synthesize everything in a Elevator Pitch presentation (1 minute).

**April 5, 13:00**:  Assignment due (static visualization).

April 5: Sketch interactive add-ons for your project. How would they work? What type of information / use would it add to the project? Start researching how to implement them

**April 12, 13:00**: Assignment due (interactive visualization).
